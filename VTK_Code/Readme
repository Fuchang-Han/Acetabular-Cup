Using our code, you can preset two-dimensional Digital Reconstruction Radiograph (DRR) from different angles according to your needs. The DRR images under different angles can be obtained on demand, such as these DRR examples. 

Note that VTK_Code runs in the visual studio environment. Run main.cpp in VTK_Start, you can obtain massive Digital Reconstruction Radiograph (DRR) images.
