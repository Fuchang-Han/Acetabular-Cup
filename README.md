# Acetabular-Cup
The “Safe Zone” Prediction of Acetabular Cup

  1. We have published an acetabular cups dataset in stereolithography (STL) format, and we view this dataset as a dynamic entity, and we plan to be growing them over time.
  2. We have published a visualization toolkit (VTK)-based rendering program. Users can preset the angles of the acetabular cup and generate massive preoperative radiography datasets according to their own needs. 
  3. In addition, we have developed the online real-time E3D modeling and design software platform to provide further insights into the “safe zone” prediction of acetabular cup. The developed software is fully open, free to download and use.

  You can download, install, and use the software in any of the following ways (i.e., Official website link, Baidu Netdisk, or Google Drive). These ways are part of the double-anonymous peer review process, which will be made available soon.
