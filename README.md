# Acetabular-Cup
The “Safe Zone” Prediction of Acetabular Cup

Users can preset the angles of the acetabular cup and generate massive preoperative radiography datasets according to their own needs. We view this dataset as a dynamic entity, and we plan to be growing them over time.

In addition, we have developed the online real-time E3D modeling and design software platform to provide further insights into the “safe zone” prediction of acetabular cup. The developed software is fully open, free to download and use (http://www.e3d-med.com/).
