  We have developed the online real-time E3D modeling and design software platform to provide further insights into the “safe zone” prediction of acetabular cup. The developed software is fully open, free to download and use.


  You can download, install, and use the software in any of the these ways(Official website link, Baidu Netdisk, or Google Drive). These ways are part of the double-anonymous peer review process, which will be made available soon.
